@article{Leek2017,
abstract = {As debate rumbles on about how and how much poor statistics is to blame for poor reproducibility, Nature asked influential statisticians to recommend one change to improve science. The common theme? The problem is not our maths, but ourselves. T o use statistics well, researchers must study how scientists analyse and interpret data and then apply that information to prevent cognitive mistakes. In the past couple of decades, many fields have shifted from data sets with a dozen measurements to data sets with millions. Methods that were developed for a world with sparse and hard-to-collect informa-tion have been jury-rigged to handle bigger, more-diverse and more-complex data sets. No wonder the literature is now full of papers that use outdated statistics, misapply statistical tests and misinterpret results. The application of P values to determine whether an analysis is interesting is just one of the most visible of many shortcomings. It's not enough to blame a surfeit of data and a lack of training in analysis (J. T. Leek and R. D. Peng Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 112, 1645–1646; 2015). It's also impractical to say that statistical metrics such as P values should not be used to make decisions. Sometimes a decision (editorial or funding, say) must be made, and clear guidelines are useful. The root problem is that we know very little about how people analyse and process information. An illustrative exception is graphs. Experiments show that people strug-gle to compare angles in pie charts yet breeze through comparative lengths and heights in bar charts (},

  abstract={Unlike equilibrium statistical mechanics, with its well-established foundations, a similar widely accepted framework for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (NESM) remains elusive. Here, we review some of the many recent activities on NESM, focusing on some of the fundamental issues and general aspects. Using the language of stochastic Markov processes, we emphasize general properties of the evolution of configurational probabilities, as described by master equations. Of particular interest are systems in which the dynamics violates detailed balance, since such systems serve to model a wide variety of phenomena in nature. We next review two distinct approaches for investigating such problems. One approach focuses on models sufficiently simple to allow us to find exact, analytic, non-trivial results. We provide detailed mathematical analyses of a one-dimensional continuous-time lattice gas, the totally asymmetric exclusion process. It is regarded as a paradigmatic model for NESM, much like the role the Ising model played for equilibrium statistical mechanics. It is also the starting point for the second approach, which attempts to include more realistic ingredients in order to be more applicable to systems in nature. Restricting ourselves to the area of biophysics and cellular biology, we review a number of models that are relevant for transport phenomena. Successes and limitations of these simple models are also highlighted.}

@article{Schappals2017,
abstract = {Thermodynamic properties are often modeled by classical force fields which describe the interactions on the atomistic scale. Molecular simulations are used for retrieving thermodynamic data from such models, and many simulation techniques and computer codes are available for that purpose. In the present round robin study, the following fundamental question is addressed: Will different user groups working with different simulation codes obtain coinciding results within the statistical uncertainty of their data? A set of 24 simple simulation tasks is defined and solved by five user groups working with eight molecular simulation codes: DL{\_}POLY, GROMACS, IMC, LAMMPS, ms2, NAMD, Tinker, and TOWHEE. Each task consists of the definition of (1) a pure fluid that is described by a force field and (2) the conditions under which that property is to be determined. The fluids are four simple alkanes: ethane, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane. All force fields consider internal degrees of freedom: OPLS, TraPPE, and a modified OPLS version with bond stretching vibrations. Density and potential energy are determined as a function of temperature and pressure on a grid which is specified such that all states are liquid. The user groups worked independently and reported their results to a central instance. The full set of results was disclosed to all user groups only at the end of the study. During the study, the central instance gave only qualitative feedback. The results reveal the challenges of carrying out molecular simulations. Several iterations were needed to eliminate gross errors. For most simulation tasks, the remaining deviations between the results of the different groups are acceptable from a practical standpoint, but they are often outside of the statistical errors of the individual simulation data. However, there are also cases where the deviations are unacceptable. This study highlights similarities between computer experiments and laboratory experiments, which are both subject not only to statistical error but also to systematic error.},

However, the process by which ligand binding induces protein conformation changes is not well understood biophysically. Rhodopsin, the mammalian dim-light receptor, is a unique test case for understanding these processes because of its switch-like activity; the ligand, retinal, is bound throughout the activation cycle, switching from inverse agonist to agonist after absorbing a photon. By contrast, the ligand-free opsin is outside the activation cycle and may behave differently. We find that retinal influences rhodopsin dynamics using an ensemble of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that in aggregate contain 100 ?s of sampling. Active retinal destabilizes the inactive state of the receptor, whereas the active ensemble was more structurally homogenous. By contrast, simulations of an active-like receptor without retinal present were much more heterogeneous than those containing retinal. These results suggest allosteric processes are more complicated than a ligand inducing protein conformational changes or simply capturing a shifted ensemble as outlined in classic models of allostery.},

It is, however, subject to statistical errors in its sampling of the underlying distribution of states. One must understand these errors in order to draw meaningful conclusions from the simulation. This is becoming ever more critical as MD simulations of even larger systems are attempted. We present here a new method for determining the extent of convergence that relies on measures of the fluctuation space sampled by the simulation without any a priori knowledge of states or partitioning of the configuration space. This method reveals long correlation times, even for simple systems, and suggests caution when interpreting macromolecular simulations. We also compare this method with previous efforts to characterize the sampling of MD simulation.},

We ask by how much the MD sampling quality for flexible molecules can be improved by two means: the use of diverse sets of trajectories starting from different initial conformations to detect deviations between samples and sampling with enhanced methods such as accelerated MD (aMD) or scaled MD (sMD) that distort the energy landscape in controlled ways. To this end, we test the effects of these approaches on MD simulations of two flexible biomolecules in aqueous solution, Met-Enkephalin (5 amino acids) and HIV-1 gp120 V3 (a cycle of 35 amino acids). We assess the convergence of the sampling quantitatively with known, extensive measures of cluster number Nc and cluster distribution entropy Sc and with two new quantities, conformational overlap Oconf and density overlap Odens, both conveniently ranging from 0 to 1.

abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm that can be used both for reconstructing the free energy and for accelerating rare events in systems described by complex Hamiltonians, at the classical or at the quantum level. In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

@article{Darve2008,
abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one ͑scalar case͒ or several ͑vector case͒ order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles ⌽ and ⌿ in N-acetylalanyl-NЈ-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

@article{Comer2015,
abstract = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

@article{Darve2001,
abstract = {A new, general formula that connects the derivatives of the free energy along the selected, generalized coordinates of the system with the instantaneous force acting on these coordinates is derived. The instantaneous force is defined as the force acting on the coordinate of interest so that when it is subtracted from the equations of motion the acceleration along this coordinate is zero. The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examples — rotation around the C–C bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement. The relative advantages of each method are discussed.},

@article{Yang2004,
abstract = {A method is proposed for improving the accuracy and efficiency of free energy simulations. The essential idea is that the convergence of the relevant measure (e.g., the free energy derivative in thermodynamic integration) is monitored in the reverse direction starting from the last frame of the trajectory, instead of the usual approach, which begins with the first frame and goes in the forward direction. This simple change in the use of the simulation data makes it straightforward to eliminate the contamination of the averages by contributions from the equilibrating region. A statistical criterion is introduced for distinguishing the equilibrated (production) region from the equilibrating region. The proposed method, called reverse cumulative averaging, is illustrated by its application to the well-studied case of the alchemical free energy simulation of ethane to methanol.},

No intermediate phase was observed at these temperatures. Composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients and associated uncertainties were estimated by three methods. The first employed fitting of the penetration curves in conjunction with the Sauer-Freise (SF) method. The second method employed a numerical solution of the Boltzmann-Matano ordinary differential equation for composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficient functions whose parameters were optimized by a least squares fitting to the data. Discrepancies between the results of these methods indicate typical uncertainties in experimental determination of diffusion coefficients. To further assess such discrepancies, a third method was employed to perform an uncertainty quantification of the diffusion coefficients via a statistical analysis based on the SF method.",

The derivation is based on standard path-integral (path probability) ideas, but recasts the weighted-ensemble approach as simple "resampling" in path space. Similar reasoning indicates that arbitrary nonstatic binning procedures, which merely guide the resampling process, are also valid. Numerical examples confirm the claims, including the use of bins which can adaptively find the target state in a simple model.},

J. 1996, 70, 97-110] to generate equilibrium trajectory ensembles and extract nonequilibrium subsets for computing kinetic quantities. States do not need to be chosen in advance. The procedure formally allows estimation of kinetic rates between arbitrary states chosen after the simulation, along with their equilibrium populations. We also describe a related history-dependent matrix procedure for estimating equilibrium and nonequilibrium observables when phase space has been divided into arbitrary non-Markovian regions, whether in WE or ordinary simulation. In this proof-of-principle study, these methods are successfully applied and validated on two molecular systems: explicitly solvated methane association and the implicitly solvated Ala4 peptide. We comment on challenges remaining in WE calculations.},
