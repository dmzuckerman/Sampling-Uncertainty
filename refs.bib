abstract = {Growing computing capacity and algorithmic advances have facilitated the study of increasingly large biomolecular systems at longer timescales. However, with these larger, more complex systems come questions about the quality of sampling and statistical convergence. What size systems can be sampled fully? If a system is not fully sampled, can certain "fast variables" be considered well-converged? How can one determine the statistical significance of observed results? The present review describes statistical tools and the underlying physical ideas necessary to address these questions. Basic definitions and ready-to-use analyses are provided, along with explicit recommendations. Such statistical analyses are of paramount importance in establishing the reliability of simulation data in any given study.},

  abstract    = {G protein-coupled receptors are vital membrane proteins that allosterically transduce biomolecular signals across the cell membrane. However, the process by which ligand binding induces protein conformation changes is not well understood biophysically. Rhodopsin, the mammalian dim-light receptor, is a unique test case for understanding these processes because of its switch-like activity; the ligand, retinal, is bound throughout the activation cycle, switching from inverse agonist to agonist after absorbing a photon. By contrast, the ligand-free opsin is outside the activation cycle and may behave differently. We find that retinal influences rhodopsin dynamics using an ensemble of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that in aggregate contain 100 ?s of sampling. Active retinal destabilizes the inactive state of the receptor, whereas the active ensemble was more structurally homogenous. By contrast, simulations of an active-like receptor without retinal present were much more heterogeneous than those containing retinal. These results suggest allosteric processes are more complicated than a ligand inducing protein conformational changes or simply capturing a shifted ensemble as outlined in classic models of allostery.},
