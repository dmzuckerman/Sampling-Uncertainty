\subsection{Scope}

This article is geared toward simulation studies attempting to quantify observables and derive reliable error bars based on `standard' canonical sampling methods (e.g., molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo) and associated `enhanced' sampling methods.
Some problems and systems may be better studied with cruder techniques and analyses, which will not be covered here.
This article also will not cover issues of systematic error arising from inaccuracy in force field (underlying model) or even from the simulation setup.
Rather, this article will take raw trajectory data at face value, assuming it is a valid outcome given the underlying model.
We emphatically will \emph{not} assume that a trajectory has been sufficiently `equilibrated'.
