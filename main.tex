\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The quantitative assessment of uncertainty and sampling quality is essential in molecular simulation.
Many systems of interest are highly complex, at the edge of current computational capacity, and simulators must understand and communicate statistical uncertainties so that `consumers' of the data understand the meaning and limitations of the simulation data.
This article covers key analyses appropriate for trajectory data generated by straightforward simulation methods such as molecular dynamics and (single Markov chain) Monte Carlo, as well as providing guidance for analyzing some `enhanced' sampling approaches.
We do not discuss \emph{systematic} errors arising from inaccuracy in the chosen model or force field.

\section{Best Practices Checklist}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Pre-simulation sanity checks and planning tips: There is no guarantee that any method (enhanced or otherwise) can sample any given system
    \begin{itemize}
    \item See best-practices papers on simulation background and planning/setup [Link out to simulation background and preparation documents - github]
    \item Are system timescales known experimentally and feasible computationally based on published literature?
      - If timescales are too long for straight-ahead MD, is an enhanced method being used for which there are precedents for systems of similar complexity?
    \item Read a good article or book on sampling assessment (this one or a reference herein).  Understanding error is a technical endeavor.
      - Key concept: Connection between the equilibrium ensemble and individual trajectory (may or may not reach equilibrium); equilibrium vs. non-equilibrium.
    \item Consider multiple runs vs. single run.  Multiple runs may be especially useful in assessing uncertainty for enhanced sampling methods.
      - Make initial configuration as diverse as possible  … but note that if results depend on initial configs, that implies insufficient sampling (to be pedantic, it always does if sampling is finite, but it’s about figuring out variability and confidence intervals
      - Look for automated construction methods for reproducibility
    \item Check your code/method via a simple benchmark system.  [Link out to software validation doc]
    \end{itemize}
\item
Perform quick-and-dirty data checks which can rule out (but not ensure) sufficient sampling: Necessary vs. sufficient
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Look at time series -- think in advance about what states should exist. How many transitions do you see? If you have 1 transition, you can’t talk about populations
    \item Plot as many properties as you can think of, even if they’re not interesting
    \item Plot pairwise configurational distances (e.g., RMSD values for biomolecules) in greyscale for $\sim$100 evenly spaced frames
    \item Visualize the trajectory graphically -- look for slow motions.  BE SKEPTICAL!
    \item Compare observable different fractions of a run (DMZ thirds idea)
    \item Andrew: short vs. very short
    \item Daniel R: Compare runs from different initial conditions - be sure initial conditions are ‘different enough’
    \end{itemize}
\item
 Remove an ‘equilibration’/’burn in’/transient portion of a single MD or MC trajectory and perform analyses only on remaining ‘production’ portion of trajectory.  \emph{Underlying concept:} An initial configuration is unlikely to be representative of the desired ensemble and the resulting relaxation process must be accounted for.
\item
 Consider computing a quantitative measure of global sampling, particularly for a biomolecular system - i.e., attempt to estimate the number of statistically independent samples in a trajectory.  \emph{Underlying concept:} Trajectory 'frames'/configurations are highly correlated because one frame is generated from the preceding one, and estimating the degree of correlation is essential to understanding overall simulation quality.
\item
 Quantify uncertainty in specific observables of interest.  \emph{Underlying concept:} The statistical uncertainty in the estimate of an observable's \emph{average} decreases as more independent samples are obtained, and it can be much smaller than the standard deviation -- which measures the range of variation in the observable.
\item
 Use special care and uncertainty analyses for enhanced sampling methods.  \emph{Underlying concept:} The use of multiple, potentially correlated trajectories within a single enhanced-sampling simulation can invalidate the assumptions underpinning traditional analyses of uncertainty.
