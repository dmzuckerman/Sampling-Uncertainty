\section{Enhanced sampling [Write as supplements, which can later be broken out as separate documents?]}
- Compare to standard sampling (e.g., straight MD) for a simple system
- Complex correlation structures in complex methods indicate comparison of multiple independent runs will be useful
    - Explain what to compare [Dan Z]
- Replica exchange [Daniel Roe]
    - Round-trips (necessary but not sufficient)
    - Compare ‘coordinate trajectories’ - distributions from temperature/Hamiltonian-wandering trajectories should match
    - Examine replica residence times
- Weighted ensemble (WE)
    - See this WE overview doc, particularly limitations section
    - Key concept: ‘Tree’ of trajectories generated by WE leads to strong correlations, requiring care
    - Key concept: WE simulation generically relaxes from the initial distribution toward the ultimate distribution which could be equilibrium (if no feedback/recycling or external driving) or a non-equilibrium steady state (if feedback from specified target to initial state)
    - Safest approach: Use multiple runs, which are fully independent.  Perform as many runs as needed to reduce the statistical uncertainty (std err of mean) for quantity of interest
    - For a single observable, the time course of the value can be analyzed using the usual methods of analyzing time-correlated data (see above - e.g., block-averaging)
