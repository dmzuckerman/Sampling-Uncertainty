\section{Computing error in specific observables}
- Basics: how to report, what goal to shoot for, significant figures
- When should you not trust uncertainties
    - Unknown unknowns
- If calculating a derived quantity, consider error in conversion from raw data 
    - Propagation of error (this doesn’t mean publishing your results!)
    - Taylor series expansion can handle cases where derived quantity is a direct function of measured data
    - Wikipedia: Propagation of uncertainty
    - Generate synthetic data with noise model [Paul]
    - Data filtering [Paul]
    - Bootstrapping [Andrew/Dan S]
used for cases where the derived quantity is not simple function of the measured data.
An Introduction to the Bootstrap
    - Need to know correlation to correctly estimate sample size
    - Otherwise just gives relative uncertainty
- Correlation time analysis [Dan Z]
- Block averaging [Dan Z/Alan?/Dan S] Flyvjberg and Petersen 
- ‘Dark uncertainty’ analysis [Paul]
- MOST OF THESE ALGORITHMS FAIL IF THE TRAJECTORY IS WAY TOO SHORT
    - If you miss the timescale by enough, you can’t tell
    - YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN ADVANCE
