\section{Quick-and-Dirty checks that can rule out good sampling}

It is difficult to establish with certainty that good sampling has been achieved, but it is not difficult to \emph{rule out} high-quality sampling.
Here we elaborate on some quick-and-dirty tests that quickly show inadequacies in sampling.

\subsection{Tests based on configurational distance measures - e.g., RMSD for biomolecules}

We will use the standard biomolecular RMSD (root mean-squared difference) as a generic distance measure for illustrative purposes.
Alternatives to RMSD could be a dihedral-angle distance or another measure specific to your system of interest.
Note that RMSD, like any distance in a high-dimensional space, becomes ``degenerate'' for larger values: given a reference configuration, there are a large number of configurations which differ from the reference by a given large RMSD; this is analogous to the increasing number of points in three-dimensional space with increasing radial distance from a reference point, except much worse because of the dimensionality.

Some qualitative tools for assessing global sampling based on RMSD were reviewed
in prior work \cite{Grossfield2009}.   The classic time series plot of RMSD with
respect to a crystal or other single reference structure can immediately
indicate whether the structure is still systematically changing.  Although this
kind of plot was historically used as a sampling test, it's really more a test
of equilibration, since the absence of increasing RMSD does not demonstrate
anything about the quality of sampling.  Moreover, it's not even a particularly
good test of equilibration, because the degeneracy of RMSD means you can't tell
if the simulation is exploring new states that are equidistant from the chosen
reference.  The upper panel of Figure \ref{f:rmsd} shows a typical curve of this
sort, taken from a simulation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin
\cite{Grossfield-2015}; the curve increases rapidly over the few nanoseconds and
then roughly plateaus.  It is difficult to assign meaning to the other features
on the curve.

A better RMSD-based convergence measure is the all-to-all RMSD plot; taking the
RMSD of each snapshot in the trajectory with respect to all others allows you to
use RMSD for what it does best, identifying very similar structures.  The lower
panel of Figure \ref{f:rmsd} shows an example of this kind of plot, applied to
the same trajectory before.  By definition, all such plots have values of zero
along the diagonal, and occupation of a given state shows up as a block of
similar RMSD along the diagonal; in this case, there are 2 main states, with one
transition occuring roughly 800 ns into the trajectory.  Off diagonal ``peaks''
(regions of low RMSD between structures sampled far apart in time) indicate that
the system is revisiting previously sampled states, a necessary condition for
good statistics.  In this case, the initial state is never sampled after the
first transition, but there are a number of small transitions within the second
state.
